# Diagrams

This directory contains architecture and flow diagrams for the demo.

## Required Diagrams

- **architecture.png** - System architecture showing AKS cluster with security tools
- **attack-flow.png** - Attack simulation flow (reconnaissance → credential theft → lateral movement)

## Generating Diagrams

These diagrams can be generated from the text descriptions in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) using tools like:

- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) - Markdown-based diagrams
- [draw.io](https://draw.io/) - Visual diagram editor
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - Hand-drawn style diagrams
